# Sexting Text Based Game

![GitHub Pipenv locked Python version](https://img.shields.io/github/pipenv/locked/python-version/erikapereira/sexting)

Sexting is a text based escape room game I am building to learn Python.
It may always be a WIP. 


This was developed in Python 3.7. 
It may run on other versions but don't ask me because I wouldn't know.

## Installation

Install and run Sexting as follows:


```
git clone https://github.com/erikapereira/sexting.git
cd sexting
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python run.py
```
